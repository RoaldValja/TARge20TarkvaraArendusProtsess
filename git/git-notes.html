        <h1>Git initialize</h1>
        <p>Git is a version control system that allows us to manage our source code history. Git is a local tool. <br>
        Repository is the location where the projects code history is stored. Branches are inside the repository, which are like folders that contain commits.
        Commits are different stages of the project code inside a branch that we save. <br>
        Version control allows us to manage different versions of our code in an efficient and easy to maintain way.</p>

        <h2>Command</h2>
        <code>$git init</code>

        <h1>Branching</h1>
        <p>All repositories have branches where all commits are kept. Branches are typically used to create new experimental code that doesn't break the main code before it has been finished and released. Branches contain commit information on who commited them, when it was commited and on what branch the commit was made on. Branches can also be merged, but if they contain conflicts, then those conflicts have to be resolved before finally committing.</p>

        <h2>Command</h2>
        <code>$git branch</code>
        <p>Show what branches are in the local repository.</p>
        <h2>Command</h2>

        <code>$git master</code>
        <p>Go into the master branch</p>
        <h2>Command</h2>
        <code>$git checkout id</code>
        <p>Change current commit head to the one with id. Any changes made in this commit won't be saved in the previous branch.</p>
        <h2>Command</h2>
        <code>$git checkout -b experimental</code>
        <p>Create a new branch named experimental.</p>

        <h1>Branch and commit deletion</h1>
        <p>You are able to delete commits until a selected commit. Entire branches can be deleted. It's also possible to revert any changes done that haven't been commited into git yet. You have to be careful with deletion, because these changes can't be reversed.</p>
        
        <h2>Command</h2>
